# Today's Focuses

* Angular - Reviewing dynamic routing and working with a database. I would like to sew up the holes in my understanding in regards to how everything (components, models, database, etc) work together and are connected. Perhaps draw out a flow chart or map to track the data-flow?

Proof:

* What is React? - To be honest I have a pretty limited understanding of what makes React special or unique in any way. I feel like I just haven't really had the time to dive into that either.

Proof:
[This React introductory tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
[Repo for that tutorial](https://github.com/lewdavidson/react-tac-toe.git)

* Writing a better README - I know they don't have to be these weird, dry documents and I know they serve a purpose but I'm not exactly sure what to include in one most of the time to be honest.

Proof:
[Cheatsheet for Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* Better and more frequent commits - How can I make informative, short, frequent commits a more consistent part of my process?

Proof:


# Further Work/Questions

* I still feel largely unprepared to go into a technical interview (some imposter syndrome/some just never doing it before) and would like to have more career training in that area.


# Work I would Like To Prioritize

* I would like to work more with Angular and React to become comfortable with the way they operate. I feel like React is going to be my most hire-able attribute and I would like to be confident in my skills.

  I will do that by:

  * Pre-work and study - I have found that watching videos (NetNinja, Trversy Media) before I get started on something new really helps my foundational knowledge feel more stable.

* I would like more technical interview prep.

  I will do that by:

    * Hosting a meet at my house with a few classmates to do mock whiteboarding sessions.

    * Watching videos and reading blogs about how to prepare for a technical interview.

# Feedback

* I want to thank you for allowing us this time. This program is extremely fast-paced and knowledge-heavy. I frequently get the feeling that I'm going to be left behind if i'm not grasping the concept. I often feel that I don't have enough time to study as fully as I would like before we move on to another subject! I know that you know how difficult this week has been for our class and I just really appreciate the opportunity to reflect and take the time to improve this things that have maybe gotten pushed aside by the next hing we have to learn!
